<p>This is an example of a OneNote-prepared blog post that is typically hard to convert to clean HTML.</p>
<p>Because
this second paragraph is actually a third one - the previous empty line will
get its own &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;. Clean HTML output needs to get rid
of it.</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p>Then
those headings.. Of course they are just &lt;p style="(bigger font,
different color)"&gt;, why bother with H1-H6?</p>
<p>It's
actually tricky to guess which heading level it should be in the output. For
example, the above is H2 but the original, messy HTML doesn't give suggest it
in any way.</p>
<h2>>Inline formatting (at least bold &amp; italic)</h2>
<p>Of course
OneNote uses &lt;font style="font-weight: bold"&gt; instead of <span style="font-weight:bold">strong</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold">b</span>,
why not. The same for italics (it doesn't use <span style="font-style:italic">em</span>
or <span style="font-style:italic">i</span>).</p>
<h2>Other mess</h2>
<p>The
exported HTML is full of lang="en-US", empty paragraphs etc. All that
needs to go.</p>
